How do I use Firebase features?

Most Firebase functions are covered by first party plugins. These plugins are first-party integrations, maintained by the Flutter team:

    firebase_admob for Firebase AdMob
    firebase_analytics for Firebase Analytics
    firebase_auth for Firebase Auth
    firebase_database for Firebase RTDB
    firebase_storage for Firebase Cloud Storage
    firebase_messaging for Firebase Messaging (FCM)
    flutter_firebase_ui for quick Firebase Auth integrations (Facebook, Google, Twitter and email)
    cloud_firestore for Firebase Cloud Firestore

You can also find some third-party Firebase plugins on Pub that cover areas not directly covered by the first-party plugins
