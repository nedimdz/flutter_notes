To take full advantage of Material Components in your app, you can declare a top level widget MaterialApp as the entry point to your application. MaterialApp is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for applications implementing Material Design. It builds upon a WidgetsApp by adding Material specific functionality.

You can also use a WidgetApp as your app widget, which provides some of the same functionality, but is not as rich as MaterialApp.

To customize the colors and styles of any child components, pass a ThemeData object to the MaterialApp widget. For example, in the code below, the primary swatch is set to blue and text selection color is red.

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        textSelectionColor: Colors.red
      ),
      home: SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}
