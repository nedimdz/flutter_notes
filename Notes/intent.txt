Flutter doesn’t really have a direct equivalent to activities and fragments; rather, in Flutter you navigate between screens, using a Navigator and Routes, all within the same Activity.

A Route is an abstraction for a “screen” or “page” of an app, and a Navigator is a widget that manages routes. A route roughly maps to an Activity, but it does not carry the same meaning. A navigator can push and pop routes to move from screen to screen. Navigators work like a stack on which you can push() new routes you want to navigate to, and from which you can pop() routes when you want to “go back”.

In Android, you declare your activities inside the app’s AndroidManifest.xml.

In Flutter, you have a couple options to navigate between pages:

    Specify a Map of route names. (MaterialApp)
    Directly navigate to a route. (WidgetApp)

The following example builds a Map.

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: MyAppHome(), // becomes the route named '/'
    routes: <String, WidgetBuilder> {
      '/a': (BuildContext context) => MyPage(title: 'page A'),
      '/b': (BuildContext context) => MyPage(title: 'page B'),
      '/c': (BuildContext context) => MyPage(title: 'page C'),
    },
  ));
}

Navigate to a route by pushing its name to the Navigator.

Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/b');

The other popular use-case for Intents is to call external components such as a Camera or File picker. For this, you would need to create a native platform integration (or use an existing plugin).




What is the equivalent of startActivityForResult()?

The Navigator class handles routing in Flutter and is used to get a result back from a route that you have pushed on the stack. This is done by awaiting on the Future returned by push().

For example, to start a location route that lets the user select their location, you could do the following:

Map coordinates = await Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/location');

And then, inside your location route, once the user has selected their location you can pop the stack with the result:

Navigator.of(context).pop({"lat":43.821757,"long":-79.226392});
