While Android treats resources and assets as distinct items, Flutter apps have only assets.
The equivalent to Android’s density buckets are:
Android density qualifier 	Flutter pixel ratio
ldpi 	0.75x
mdpi 	1.0x
hdpi 	1.5x
xhdpi 	2.0x
xxhdpi 	3.0x
xxxhdpi 	4.0x

Assets are located in any arbitrary folder—Flutter has no predefined folder structure. 
You declare the assets (with location) in the pubspec.yaml file, and Flutter picks them up.

As of Flutter beta 2, assets are stored in the native asset folder, and are accessed on the native side using Android’s AssetManager:

val flutterAssetStream = assetManager.open("flutter_assets/assets/my_flutter_asset.png")


To add a new image asset called my_icon.png to our Flutter project, for example, and deciding that it should live in a folder we arbitrarily called images, you would put the base image (1.0x) in the images folder, and all the other variants in sub-folders called with the appropriate ratio multiplier:

images/my_icon.png       // Base: 1.0x image
images/2.0x/my_icon.png  // 2.0x image
images/3.0x/my_icon.png  // 3.0x image

Next, you’ll need to declare these images in your pubspec.yaml file:

assets:
 - images/my_icon.jpeg

You can then access your images using AssetImage:

return AssetImage("images/my_icon.jpeg");

or directly in an Image widget:

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image.asset("images/my_image.png");
}

Where do I store strings? How do I handle localization?

Flutter currently doesn’t have a dedicated resources-like system for strings. At the moment, the best practice is to hold your copy text in a class as static fields and accessing them from there. For example:

class Strings {
  static String welcomeMessage = "Welcome To Flutter";
}

Then in your code, you can access your strings as such:

Text(Strings.welcomeMessage)
